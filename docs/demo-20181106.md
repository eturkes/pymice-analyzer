## Demo of PyMICE Analyzer
* Let me show you what it does so far.
* First, let's download the program.
* Environments for usage and development, with upgrade scripts.
* Now, let's install the program.
* We can now exit the installer directory, and use it!
* On the left are all available paradigms. 
* On the right are arguments.
* We can override "Universal Settings" and set paradigm-specific settings.
* Arguments are saved so that they are loaded as defaults on next run.
* Let's run it with these settings.
* The directory is setup to make sharing results easy.
* data is a symlink to the raw data, rather than a big copy operation.
* output is where figures will save to.
* pipeline is where the code lives.
* docker-jupyter-notebook.sh is the recommended way to inspect the pipeline.
* Unfortunately, right now have to move up one directory for it to work correctly.
* The notebook is designed to be easy to read and expose all useful parameters to edit.
* Most of the pipeline is still unimplemented at the moment.
* Modules for the pipeline are actually stored in a separate project, pymice-modules.
* This is so that it can be pulled from git and made up-to-date easily.
* If a file was edited locally, it is appended with "old" during the update.
* There's still a lot of work to be done, but I think the overall structure is there.
* See the README in PyMICE Tools for more info on overall scope.
