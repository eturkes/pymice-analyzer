# PyMICE Analyzer
#### *This project is a work-in-progress*

PyMICE Analyzer is a GUI and CLI project creator and pipeline manipulator. It is
distinct from full-featured platforms in that it leverages the power and familiarity of
standard data science tools like Jupyter and Docker. Projects are structured to suit the
particular workflow of Intellicage with PyMICE and are bundled with a variety of
utilities to encourage proper archivial for reproducibility. Available pipeline options
are pulled directly from PyMICE Modules and included in the project structure, allowing
for easy updating and shipping of specific versions with the code.
